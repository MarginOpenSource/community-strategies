### Update

## v1.2.9-18 2022-11-21

* #36
* #37

## v1.2.9-14 2022-11-11
### Fixed
* After restart from saved state incorrect value for first_run may cause incorrect data to be saved
for the start deposit. Because of this, the control of initial balances may not work correctly.
* Calculate parameters for grid. Adding price limitation based on [PERCENT_PRICE](https://github.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs/blob/master/filters.md#percent_price)
filter. Without such limit, the task of finding grid parameters for a given volume has several solutions, including in
the area of negative price values. This is an unlikely event that could have been within the Reverse buy cycle and
high volatility

### Update
* Changed logic for place order error handling. Before - save to hold uncompleted order and wait event from exchange.
Now - resend order after timeout.
* Refactoring place_grid() and calc_grid()

### Added for new features
* Before start of cycle and in periodically report are showed free assets' data, what volume of coins does
not participate in the turnover

* #7 Allow to withdraw and deposit on active strategy with autocorrection initial balance and depo. See
[manual](https://github.com/DogsTailFarmer/martin-binance#deposit-and-withdraw-assets-on-active-strategy) for detail

## v1.2.9-1 2022-10-14
### Update
* Refusal to use PROFIT_REVERSE parameter.
Valid for Reverse cycle. For a small deposit, the cycle income can be equal to the minimum order size step.
If you divide it into parts to increase the deposit and make a profit, as a result of rounding the deposit amount does
not increase, which negatively affects the ability of the strategy to complete the reverse cycle.
Instead, all cycle profits are allocated either to increase the deposit (for an odd cycle number)
or to accumulate profits (for an even cycle number)
